    <p>Since our sprint team meeting, we have worked to create a functional 
    website for the user. We have created the homepage, an About Us page, an 
    Events page, and more for the user to browse and have allowed the user to 
    access and search our API for events. We initially encountered a roadblock 
    in getting the environment setup, but with some help from Kyle everything 
    was functional pretty quickly. Apart from the initial setup, one of our 
    main challenges during this sprint was figuring out git and how to 
    branch/merge properly but that was quickly sorted out with some googling 
    and trial and error. We worked through our troubles pretty seamlessly 
    because the team had good communication through Facebook chat. Everyone 
    was up-to-date on what we were doing and everyone was updating the Waffle.io 
    board properly which helped facilitate a smooth workflow. We are currently
    passing 37 of the 41 tests at the end of the first sprint. </p>
